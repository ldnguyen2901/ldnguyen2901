Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
<br> My name is Le Dinh Nguyen. I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Science, which is located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As a Computer Science student, I have developed a strong interest in software development, programming languages, and algorithms. I am passionate about learning new things, exploring the latest technology and innovations, and using my knowledge to solve real life problems.

During my time at the University of Science, I have had many opportunities working on several group projects and individual assignments, which has given me hands-on experience in software development, coding, debugging, and testing. I have also been involved in several coding competitions and ACM-ICPC, where I have collaborated with other students for finding innovative solutions for complex problems.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I also enjoy playing sports such as swimming and badminton, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.

As a Computer Science student, I am eager to use all I have learnt to make positive impacts on society. I am looking forward to pushing myself into new opportunities, developing my skills and knowledge. And one day in the near future, I will be able to make the world a better place.
