Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
<br> My name is Le Dinh Nguyen and I am a 4th-year student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Science, which is located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As a Computer Science student, I have developed a strong interest in software development, programming languages, and algorithms. I am passionate about learning new things, exploring the latest technology trends and innovations, and applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

During my time at the University of Science, I have had the opportunity to work on several group projects and individual assignments, which have given me hands-on experience in software development, coding, debugging, and testing. I have also been involved in several coding competitions and ACM-ICPC, where I have collaborated with other students to finding a inovation solution for complex problems.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I also enjoy playing sports such as swimming and badminton, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.

As a Computer Science student, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on society. I am excited to explore new opportunities in the field of technology and contribute to the development of innovative solutions that can solve real-world problems.
